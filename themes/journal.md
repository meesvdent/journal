### Ideas
* macro to enter checkboxes quickly
* week/subject/ideas/todo parcer (python?)
* enter stuff directly from command line > daily note > overview
* a way to make "bullet journal commands" like postpone to tomorrow
* a way to get all this into the readme

### Thoughts
* everything "lives" in the notes, you just make different overviews
